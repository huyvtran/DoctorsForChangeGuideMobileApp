<li><p><strong>Vote</strong> - Find out what the candidates think about your issues!</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Find a role model</strong> - There are many attendings out there who do great advocacy work - ask them if you can join them from time to time!</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Educate yourself on the issues</strong> - Like reading this guide! Or newspapers... and there are always lectures in the med center about advocacy topics.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Help your patients!</strong> - Ask your patients about these issues (use this guide!), and get your patients referred to community organizations that can help!</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Join an advocacy organization</strong> (or at least their list serve...) - Yes, you have limited time to participate in advocacy with studying and taking call, but you should have time to stay up to date on the activities of the organization, and can participate when you have time.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Telephone, fax/email, or write a letter to your government officials</strong> - 1 phone call = the voice of 1000 constituents in the minds of your reps!</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Advertise your issue with a badge or button and talk to anyone who will listen</strong> - In clinic, at the grocery store, everywhere!</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Help others learn about the issues and get them involved with advocacy!</strong> - Educate your colleagues (incorporate advocacy topics into your Morning Report presentations or learning issue reports); write letters to your representatives that your colleagues can sign as well.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Volunteer</strong> - There are always opportunities to give free shots/ work at health fairs, walk to support a cause, visit a school to promote healthy living...</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Want to start a project?</strong> - Ask your mentor or an organization like DFC to help you! And apply for grants - funding for advocacy projects is out there (and attainable)!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Visit the "Advocacy" section of our website to see how you can get involved with the advocacy efforts we are making through DFC - we are always looking for more helping hands!</p>
