Texas, serving 79,328 patients.<sup>1</sup></p>
</li>
<li><p>42% of all hospitals in Texas offer Palliative Care, including 15
hospitals in Harris County<sup>2</sup></p>
</li>
<li><p>Palliative Care is not Hospice. Both are multi-disciplinary,
symptom-based approaches to caring for patients with complex and
life threatening illnesses. However, PALLIATIVE CARE can be
implemented at any time in the disease process regardless of stage,
prognosis, or other treatments while HOSPICE is an insurance benefit
reserved for the last 6 months of life.</p>
